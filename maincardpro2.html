                        <p>In many research, it‚Äôs not just about knowing a language really well or having a particular
                            educational background. It‚Äôs that the really talented programmers have mastered the
                            fundamentals. That foundation is what enables them to build great things and come up with
                            breakthrough ideas.</p>
                        <p>
                        <p>When learning to code, it can be intimidating trying to figure out where to even start. It
                            can feel a lot like trying to write a 200-page novel without knowing how to read or write.
                            How can you even begin People say that getting experience with coding is what really lets
                            you learn. But if you need experience to learn to code, how can you get that if you don‚Äôt
                            know how to code in the first place? It can seem like a Catch-22.</p>

                        <p>Maybe you‚Äôve thought about getting started, but felt too overwhelmed to even try.</p>

                        <p>Believe it or not, just installing the programs to run your first program can be quite a
                            challenging undertaking. Rather than installing the programs on your computer‚Äî which,

                        <h3>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
                        <p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is what powers all of the websites and web applications you
                            use every day. Basically, it‚Äôs the stuff that web browsers know how to show the user. Right
                            now, if you right-click this page and click ‚ÄúView Page Source,‚Äù you‚Äôll see a mess of a whole
                            bunch of code that represents this page. If it looks confusing or overwhelming to you now,
                            don‚Äôt sweat it.</p>

                        <p> Learning HTML is fairly straightforward and shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for you.</p>
                        <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
                        <p>CSS is what makes pages look the way they do. HTML is the content or the ‚Äústuff‚Äù that‚Äôs on
                            the page. CSS is the ruleset that describes how the page should look. For example, making
                            the headlines blue is something that can be done with CSS.</p>

                        <p> Just like HTML, CSS is pretty easy to pick up. Learning CSS probably makes sense to do in
                            parallel with HTML.</p>

                        <h3>A Programming Language</h3>
                        <p>If you want to be a web developer, you‚Äôre going to need to learn a programming language.
                            Programming languages are instruction sequences that computers can understand. While they
                            may seem scary at first, skill with programming languages is a cornerstone of web
                            development.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, at this juncture you‚Äôre going to have to pick a language to learn. A couple
                            things to keep in mind:</p>

                        <p>First, know that this isn‚Äôt a huge commitment. You can learn one programming language today,
                            and a different one later. Various programming languages often have a lot of things in
                            common. Picking up your first coding language is a bit tricky. Learning your second one is
                            generally easier.</p>

                        <p> So don‚Äôt let analysis paralysis set in. Make a decision, give it a shot, and try to learn
                            one. We generally suggest people start by learning Ruby, but the detail is far less
                            important than making the decision and pulling the trigger.</p>

                        <p> Your practical options here are: Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++. If you choose any of
                            these, you‚Äôll be able to pick the others up fairly quickly.</p>

                        <p> So why do you need to learn a programming language? Basically, the HTML web pages you‚Äôll
                            want to build are not written from scratch, but instead are generated by code. Web
                            developers will write programs that build HTML pages, which will support features like user
                            login and image uploading, which are more complicated than just a plain old HTML page.</p>

                        <h3>A Web Framework</h3>
                        <div class="maincardimage p-4 mb-3">
                            <img src="/image/web framework.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p>There are some problems that developers have faced time and time again. If you‚Äôre looking to
                            become a web developer, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to keep reinventing the wheel. Instead, you
                            can step on the backs of giants and make awesome apps! Web frameworks basically make it so
                            you can build out applications fast!</p>

                        <p> On top of that, people who build out web frameworks have spent a long time thinking about
                            security. If you use a web framework, your site will generally be secure against common
                            types of attacks even without your awareness of them.</p>

                        <p>Is your app protected against CSRF attacks? SQL injection? If you use a web framework, you
                            don‚Äôt even need to know what those are and you should be safe from hackers‚Äô harm.</p>

                        <p>So what frameworks are out there? Well, it depends which programming language you choose. If
                            you chose Ruby, the most common framework is ‚ÄúRuby on Rails.‚Äù If you‚Äôre looking for a job as
                            a web developer, most Ruby jobs use Rails. Sintra is another common framework, but there are
                            dozens of other lesser used ones.</p>

                        <p>If you‚Äôre using JavaScript, the ExpressJS web framework is the big powerhouse that most
                            people use. If you‚Äôre in Java, the Play! framework is common. In Python, there is Django,
                            Pylons, and many more.</p>

                        <p>We generally suggest learning Rails first.</p>

                        <h3>Now take action!</h3>
                        <p>You have everything you need to start taking action and actually write code and learn to
                            program! Dedicate a few hours each week to begin to hone the craft! You‚Äôll be amazed by how
                            much you can learn (and how fun programming is!). Writing your first lines of code are the
                            first steps to coding success!</p>
