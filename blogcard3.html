                        <p><strong>System design </strong> is the process of designing the elements of a system such as
                            the architecture, modules and components, the different interfaces of those components and
                            the data that goes through that system.</p>

                        <p><strong>System Analysis </strong> is the process that decomposes a system into its component
                            pieces for the purpose of defining how well those components interact to accomplish the set
                            requirements.

                        </p>


                        <p>The purpose of the System Design process is to provide sufficient detailed data and
                            information about the system and its system elements to enable the implementation consistent
                            with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture.</p>

                            <li><strong> Architecture - </strong>This is the conceptual model that defines the
                                structure, behavior and more views of a system. We can use flowcharts to represent and
                                illustrate the architecture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modules - </strong>This are components that handle one specific tasks in a
                                system. A combination of the modules make up the system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Components -</strong> This provides a particular function or group of related
                                functions. They are made up of modules.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interfaces -</strong> This is the shared boundary across which the components of

                        <h3>Major Tasks Performed During the System Design Process</h3>
                        <p>

                        <h4> 1. Initialize design definition</h4>
                        <p>
                            <li>Plan for and Identify the technologies that will compose and implement the systems
                                elements
                                and their physical interfaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Determine which technologies and system elements have a risk to become obsolete, or
                                evolve
                                during the operation stage of the system. Plan for their potential replacement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Document the design definition strategy, including the need for and requirements of any
                                enabling systems, products, or services to perform the design.
                        </p>
                        <h4>2. Establish design characteristics</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>Define the design characteristics relating to the architectural characteristics and
                                check
                                that they are implementable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Define the interfaces that were not defined by the System Architecture process or that
                                need
                                to be refined as the design details evolve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Define and document the design characteristics of each system element2.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3. Assess alternatives for obtaining system elements</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>Assess the design options
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Select the most appropriate alternatives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>If the decision is made to develop the system element, rest of the design definition
                                process
                                and the implementation process are used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>If the decision is to buy or reuse a system
                                element, the acquisition process may be used to obtain the system element.
                        </p>
                        <h4>4. Manage the design </h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>Capture and maintain the rationale for all selections among alternatives and decisions
                                for
                                the design, architecture characteristics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Assess and control the evolution of the design characteristics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> Factors that Affect Technology Trade-offs during System Design
                        </p>

                        <h4> Scale of Product</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li> For example, enterprise software companies that are building system-level software
                                prioritize
                                reliability because customers need to use them. Each change needs to be rigorously
                                tested, and
                                often approved before it can be released.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> Meanwhile, consumer internet companies spend time and money on making their UX
                                delightful so
                                that people want to use them. Reliability is something they‚Äôre willing to sacrifice.
                                Since many
                                are web-based applications, they can iterate quickly and release changes frequently.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Time</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li> Learning new technologies sometimes often takes time. The trade-offs in this instance
                                will be
                                made according to which stack/technology will be in time with the set delivery dates. If
                                switching to a new stack/technology will result in a major shift on the delivery dates
                                and major
                                inconveniences to the stakeholders then the switch can be held off until an appropriate
                                time.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Cost</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li> On a larger scale Technology decisions are made based on which is more cost effective,
                                where a
                                comparison can be done on which will be more effective between buying an off the shelf
                                system
                                and customizing it or building a new system.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Efficiency</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>Technology trade offs are also done based on which technology is more efficient for
                                example
                                choosing between ReactJs or AngularJs for a front end application.</li>
                            <br>

                        <h4>User Experience and Support</h4>

                        <p>The amount of support and documentation available on a given technology can also be a
                            determining factor on the decisions. Working with Technologies that have a large support
                            base,
                            comprehensive documentation and A good user experience is much easier and take a very short
                            time
                            to ramp up on due to the large amount of resources available to support it.</p>
                        <h4> Maintainability</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>maintainability in this case is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order
                                to
                                correct errors, fix bugs and add additional features. Trade-offs decisions will be made
                                based on
                                the maintainability of the Technology
                        </p>
                        <h4> Reliability</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li>In this case the trade offs are made based on the Technology that performs consistently
                                well and
                                consistently upgrading to more efficient versions.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Scalability</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li> Technology trade offs are also made based on the technologies that are more scalable
                                and able to
                                handle increase loads efficiently without a break in the system efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <h4>MVC Design pattern</h4>
                        <p> The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a
                            data
                            model, presentation information, and control information.</p>

                        <p> MVC mostly relates to the user Interface/interaction layer of an application.</p>

                        <p> In the MVC pattern the user sees the View which is updated by the model which is turn
                            manipulated by the Controller.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            <li><strong> The Model</strong> contains only the pure application data, it contains no
                                logic describing how to present the data to a user. They are the parts of the
                                application that implement the logic for the application‚Äôs data domain. They retrieve
                                and store model state in a database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li><strong> The View </strong>presents the model‚Äôs data to the user. The view can only be
                                used to access the model‚Äôs data. They are the components that display the application‚Äôs
                                user interface (UI).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li><strong> The Controller </strong>exists between the view and the model. It listens to
                                events triggered by the view and executes the appropriate commands. They are the
                                components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a
                                view to render that displays UI.
                        </p>
                        <h4> Advantages of the MVC design pattern</h4>

                        <p>
                            <li> Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for
                                a
                                specific model are also grouped together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> Low coupling ‚Äî The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling
                                among
                                models, views or controllers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> Models can have multiple views.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li> Ease of modification ‚Äî Because of the separation of responsibilities, future
                                development or
                                modification is easier
                        </p>
