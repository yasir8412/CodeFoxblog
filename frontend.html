              Development. But what does that mean? Let's See - üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 23, 2022 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-yasir-028/"
                target="_blank">Yasir</a></p>
            <p>In this article, I will explain what Front End Development is, what skills you need to become a Front End
              Developer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>What is Front End Development?:-</h1>
            <div class="imagefrontend p-4 mb-3">
              <img src="/image/frontend.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications‚Äîthat is, the part
              that users actually see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using
              web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or
              app.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>HTML: the key front-end technology :-</h3>
            <div class="imagefrontend p-4 mb-3">
              <img src="/image/html1.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="">
            </div>
            <p><strong> HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) </strong>is a computer language designed to create websites
              that later can be explored by anybody who accesses the Internet. HTML is normally employed to structure a
              web document. It defines such elements as headlines or paragraphs and enables embedding images, video, and
              other media.</p>

            <p>Everything you see on a website, like buttons, links, animations, and more, were created by a front end
              web developer. It is the front end developer's job to take the vision and design concept from the client
              and implement it through code.</p>

            <p>Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and
              computer screens).</p>


            <div class="imagefrontend p-4 mb-3">
              <img src="/image/html-code.png.webp" width="900px" height="300px" alt="">
            </div>
            <ul type="square">
              <li>
                <p>The text between < html> and < /html> specifies the web page, while the text between < body> and <
                          /body> determines the visible content.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  < !DOCTYPE html> on the top is the Document Type Declaration for HTML5. If it‚Äôs not included,
                    different browsers will render it in their way.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>This is how we gradually move to HTML5.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>CSS: Styling your facade:-</h3>

            <div class="imagefrontend p-4 mb-3">
              <img src="/image/css.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="">
            </div>
            <p><strong> CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a style sheet language. It‚Äôs applied to define how
              HTML elements are
              supposed to be presented on a webpage in terms of design, layout, and variations for diverse devices with
              different screen sizes. CSS masters the layout of numerous different web pages at a time.</p>

            <p><strong>How it works.</strong> CSS interacts with HTML elements, the components of a web page.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To communicate with HTML, CSS uses <strong>selectors.</strong> A selector is the part of CSS code
                defining which HTML piece the CSS styling will impact.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> A declaration </strong>contains properties and values that are employed by the selector.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Properties</strong> define font size, color, and margins. Values are the settings for these
                properties.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>CSS is written in plain text over a text editor or word processor on a computer. If you were to examine
              how the CSS code is implemented to HTML content, there are three ways to do so:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>External style sheets are stored as <strong>.css</strong> files and can be applied to define the
                appearance of a whole website via a single file, instead of putting extra instances of CSS code to every
                HTML element which has to be modified. To use an external style sheet, .html files need to contain a
                header section that connects to the external style sheet.</li>
              <li>Internal style sheets are CSS directions put straight into the header of a particular <strong>.html
                </strong>page.</li>
              <li>Inline styles are snippets of CSS recorded into HTML code itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <h4>CSS frameworks:-</h4>A CSS framework is a set of default CSS and HTML files. It extends a front-end
            developer‚Äôs capabilities for website design. In addition to assisting while building a responsive design,
            CSS frameworks also present distinct and symmetric layouts, saving developers from writing code from ground
            zero at every occasion. They are usually considered a good choice to fit diverse platforms and screen sizes.
            With common user interface components, grid systems, layouts, and many other features, CSS frameworks
            considerably accelerate development workflow. Many frameworks exist in the CSS Universe:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Full featured (Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, and more),

              </li>
              <li>
                Aimed at Material Design: (Materialize and Material Design Lite),

              </li>
              <li>Lightweight (Pure).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <h4>Preprocessors ‚Äì Sass and LESS:- </h4>Drafting CSS is routine, while short tasks such as looking up color
            values, closing tags, or any other repetitive operations take a lot of time. That‚Äôs where a preprocessor
            comes in handy. A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that expands CSS and assembles it into general
            CSS.</p>

            <p>Sass and LESS are the most common preprocessors. They share some common basics, such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Syntax elements
              </li>
              <li>
                Backward compatibility with normal CSS files
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, there are also a lot of differences between them.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Sass means Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. Sass runs on Ruby and is rendered on the server side. Due
                to its Ruby language origin, the installation is provided via so-called gems (multiple Ruby/Rails
                libraries).
              </li>
              <li>
                LESS stands for Leaner Style Sheets. It‚Äôs a JavaScript library and is rendered on the client side in the
                browser. Developers choose LESS much more regularly when using JavaScript with style sheets. It
                resembles composing regular CSS. The technology allows for reusing pieces of CSS within LESS files.
              </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>DOM: the web page structure:-</h3>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is defined as a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It
              interprets the page so that programs can modify the document structure, style, and content. The DOM
              renders the document as nodes and objects, enabling programming languages to connect to the page.</p>

            <p><strong> How it works.</strong> Consider a web page as a document that can be either presented in the
              browser window or as the HTML source code. The <strong>Document Object Model (DOM) </strong>represents
              this document so it can be modified. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which
              can be altered with a scripting language like JavaScript.

              The DOM must adhere to W3C and WHATWG standards that are executed in most current browsers. The modern DOM
              is built using multiple <strong>APIs</strong> that work together. The core DOM specifies the objects that
              entirely explain a document and the objects within it.</p>

            <h3>JavaScript: making the Web alive:-</h3>
            <div class="imagefrontend p-4 mb-3">
              <img src="/image/javascript.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="">
            </div>
            <p><strong> JavaScript (JS)</strong> is one of the most popular scripting languages. It‚Äôs mostly renowned
              for providing a full stack of technologies for both front-end and back-end development. As we are talking
              about the first one, it‚Äôs applied to make web pages dynamic.</p>

            <p><strong> How JavaScript works.</strong> JS boosts a website‚Äôs overall interactivity. It enables modeling
              animated UI components such as image sliders, pop-ups, extensive site navigation menus, and more.
              JavaScript provides a website with extended functionality that isn‚Äôt otherwise achievable with HTML and
              CSS alone. JavaScript allows web pages to reply to users‚Äô actions and dynamically refresh themselves.
              Thanks to JavaScript, this process doesn‚Äôt demand a page reload to alter its representation.</p>

            <h4>JavaScript frameworks and libraries and why we need them :-</h4>
            <p><strong> Frameworks </strong>are templates to create a website or a web application. They provide a
              structure (such as a skeleton or scaffolding) on which to arrange the whole project. While the framework
              sets the page templates, they build the structure with particular allocated areas to embed a framework
              code in.</p>

            <p> So, JavaScript frameworks are complete sets of tools to form and arrange a website or web application.
            </p>

            <p><strong> Libraries </strong> are sets of prewritten code snippets used and reused to implement core
              features of JavaScript. The snippet can be easily integrated into an existing project code when necessary.
            </p>

            <p>So, libraries are specialized tools for particular coding needs, not an all-purpose machine for grooming
              the whole existing project.

            </p>
            <h4>Main frameworks and libraries to know :-</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Angular </strong>is a front-end framework powered by Google that is compatible with most of the
              common code editors. Angular is intended to create dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs), and
              progressive web-apps. Upon its initial release, the framework was most appreciated for its ability to
              convert HTML-based documents into dynamic content. Angular is among the most popular front-end frameworks.
              You can explore this topic in our article on the pros and cons of Angular development.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Vue.js </strong>is yet another open-source framework for SPAs. It employs a component-based
              development model and enables attaching components to a project. Vue.js is an example of a library that is
              more of a framework. To utilize Vue.js, knowledge of HTML and CSS is an absolute requirement. It suggests
              a whole bunch of templates and patterns applied in development. Vue is primarily recognized for the small
              size of documents and HTML-based syntax. Again, to immerse yourself in Vue.js advantages and disadvantages
              click the link.</p>

            <p><strong>Ember.js </strong>is a framework for SPAs, mobile, and desktop applications. It uses the
              model-view-view-model (MVVM) pattern. Ember tools enable designing a development environment, while its
              command-line interface gives tools for script automation.</p>

            <p><strong> React</strong> is an open-source library for building dynamic user interfaces, born and bred by
              Facebook. The framework is applied to create web-applications with multiple dynamic components. It relies
              on JavaScript and JSX, a Facebook PHP language extension. React enables building reusable HTML elements
              for the front end. React also includes React Native, a dedicated cross-platform mobile development
              framework. To discover more about the pros and cons of React and React Native, consider exploring our
              article on this subject.</p>

            <p><strong> jQuery</strong>, in turn, is aimed at controlling HTML documents. It has a simple API to control
              events and design animation in browsers. Aside from that, jQuery is applied to manipulate the Document
              Object Model (DOM) and serves as a plugin development tool as well. It also comes with a lighter
              cross-browser library, jQuery UI for a mobile framework jQuery Mobile and for graphic interface
              construction.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Let‚Äôs Recap</h4>

              We admit that stepping into front-end technologies can be a little dazzling, even with the basics. So,
              let‚Äôs sum up what we‚Äôve learned.</p>

            <p><strong> HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is a computer language for building websites. It‚Äôs
              usually applied to structure a web document.</p>

            <p> <strong>CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) </strong>is a style sheet language. It‚Äôs used to specify the
              representation of HTML elements on a webpage. CSS scope includes the design, layout, and variations in
              display for diverse devices and screen sizes.</p>

            <p><strong> DOM (or Document Object Model)</strong> is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
              It contains the page info so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.</p>

            <p> <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a scripting language. In the front-end, it‚Äôs used to make web pages
              dynamic. Additionally, it provides full-stack technologies with libraries and frameworks for both
              client-side and server-side scripting.</p>

            <p><strong> AJAX.</strong> AJAX (or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a complex of techniques to create
              websites and web applications with dynamically uploaded content without creating a new data record.
