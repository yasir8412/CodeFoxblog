                        <h1>Programming</h1>

                        <p>To learn Programming, one must have a quality understanding of the fundamentals of the
                            programming language, data structure, and algorithms. </p>

                        <div class="maincardimage p-4 mb-3">
                            <img src="/image/frontend.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>To follow the instructions, the computer has to understand the language of your command.
                            That‚Äôs the function of a programming language.</p>

                        <p> Programming language is the paintbrush in this scenario. It enables us to translate the
                            binary digits (0s and 1s) into something understandable by us humans so that we can read and
                            write the programs. Programming languages are responsible for almost everything we see today
                            in the digital world.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1> What is Syntax in Programming Language?</h1>
                        <p>
                            Syntax refers to the rules and structure that make up a language. It controls the structure
                            of the symbols, punctuation, and words in a programming language.</p>

                        <p> How one needs to study grammar to speak correctly, syntax plays the same role in
                            programming. While speaking, you can get away with a few grammatical errors here and there,
                            but if you apply the wrong syntax to a program, it won‚Äôt be understood by the compiler or
                            the interpreter resulting in a program failure. </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like the languages we speak, every programming language has its own set of rules that
                            governs the composition. of a command. However, these are minute changes and once you have a
                            good understanding of one language, you can use that framework in learning other languages.
                        </p>

                            What is Array in Data Structures?
                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            An array is a data structure used to store the elements of the same data type such as
                            integers or strings. Arrays store multiple data elements of the same type in adjacent memory
                            locations.</p>

                        <p>In simple words, arrays are rectangular arrangements of objects in rows and columns.</p>

                        <p>Egg cartons would be a real-life example of arrays.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            Why do we use Array?
                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            Think of the seating arrangement in a movie theatre. There are hundreds of seats and if each
                            one of these seats was to be declared/addressed individually, there will be time and memory
                            problems. To avoid this, seats are arranged in the form of rows and columns and each seat is
                            marked by a combination of row number and column number (like 7C, G9). This structure
                            remains fixed for all the shows so they don‚Äôt have to change the address every time.
                        </p>

                        <p>Note: Indexing in an array starts from 0, the first array element is indexed with 0.

                        </p>

                            What are the types of Arrays?

                        <p>
                            ----> 2-d Array
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            Stacks in Data Structure
                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            Stack is a linear sequence of elements that follows a particular order. In stacks, the
                            addition of elements and the removal of elements both happen at the same end.</p>

                        <p>Consider a pile of books that have been kept over each other(in the stack from), now if you
                            have to add a book, you‚Äôd add it at the top of the stack. Even if you have to remove a
                            certain book in the middle, you‚Äôd start with removing the first book. In any case,
                            operations start at the top end of the stack. </p>

                        <p>This principle is called ‚Äòlast in first out‚Äô (LIFO) order as the book at the top is the first
                            one to be removed and the bottommost book would be in the stack for the longest time period.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            ‚ÄòPush‚Äô in this case, is the process of inserting or adding an element and ‚ÄòPop‚Äô means
                            removing an element. </p>

                        <p>Here, you can clearly see that you can‚Äôt pop 1 without first popping 3 and 2 respectively.
                        </p>

                        <p>We can implement a stack using arrays, structure, and linked lists and stacks can be either
                            of a fixed size or dynamic size.
                        </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            A queue is majorly similar to stacks in the sense that it‚Äôs an abstract data structure
                            (ADS), the only difference being- Queues are open at both ends. </p>

                        <p>We use one end of the queue to insert data (Enqueuing) and the other end to remove data
                            (Dequeuing), unlike stacks where both processes take place at the same end. </p>

                        <p>A real-life example would be a queue of people in front of the ATM. The first person in the
                            row collects his cash and separates himself from the line at the front end, while a new
                            person joins the line at the back end. </p>

                        <p>This is a First-In-First-Out methodology i.e. the data stored first would be accessed first.
                        </p>

                        <ul> Apart from Enqueuing and Dequeuing, these are a few functions required for the efficient
                            functioning of Queues:

                            <li>peek() ‚Äì This function brings the selected element at the front of the queue without
                                removing it. </li>
                            <li>isfull() ‚Äì It checks if the queue is full. It returns false otherwise.</li>
                            <li>isempty() ‚Äì It‚Äôs the opposite of IsFull and returns true if the queue is empty.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Note: These functions work with Stack too as they‚Äôre both abstract data types (ADS).
                        </p>

                            What are Linked Lists?
                        </h3>
                        <p>


                            A linked list is also a linear data structure (just like arrays), but it‚Äôs different in the
                            way that the elements aren‚Äôt stored in contiguous locations. Instead, they‚Äôre connected
                            through links. Each node contains its data and a link to the next node.</p>

                        </p>For instance, you must have seen/played those treasure hunt games where a person has to
                        solve some puzzle and then they get the clue to the next step and this follows until they find
                        the treasure.


                        </p>
                        <p>Insertion and Deletion processes are easy in a linked list as all elements don‚Äôt need to be
                            shifted, one simply has to update the link in the pointer.
                        </p>

                            Graphs are a non-linear data structure that represents the relationship between elements.
                            Each graph consists of nodes (elements) and edges (links between elements). </p>

                        <p>Take the example of a social media network, where each individual is a node and they‚Äôre
                            interconnected with networks/lines that are called edges.

                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that we have learned about different structures that store the inputs, let‚Äôs understand

                            Algorithms are a set of rules/instructions that guides the program to solve problems or
                            complete certain tasks. </p>

                        <p>In general, algorithms are all around us. We know them as ‚Äòprocess‚Äô. For example, if you‚Äôre
                            making tea, you‚Äôd follow the process including boiling milk, adding tea leaves and sugar,
                            and then only you can enjoy the first sip. </p>

                        <p>Similarly, a computer would perform a job only if we feed the correct algorithm to it. Many a
                            time, we hear things like; Instagram or Twitter has changed their algorithm. It simply means
                            they change the functionality of certain programs which in turn changes the parameters for
                            post reach, post engagement, etc.</p>

                        <p>To understand algorithms in programming, we need to focus on the following components:

                            All of us want quick and efficient results no matter what actions we‚Äôre performing. We
                            innovate, improvise and try to come up with the best possible solutions.</p>

                        <p>Writing algorithms is no different. We tend to write algorithms that are simple,
                            sophisticated and take less time to run.</p>

                        <p><strong> Complexity</strong> is the time taken by the algorithm to run as a function of the

                        <p><strong>Space Complexity </strong>tells the amount of space used by the algorithm to execute

                        <p>

                        </p>A sorting algorithm is the set of instructions we write to arrange data in a specified
                        order. We can use numerical and alphabetical orders to sort data. </p>

                        <p>Sorting helps in the optimization for data-searching and also makes it easily readable. </p>

                        <p>A few real-life scenarios of sorting include a dictionary or an attendance register at
                            schools where they sort the words and names using an alphabetical algorithm. </p>

                        <p>Based on their function, sorting algorithms can be either adaptive or non-adaptive. </p>

                        <p><strong> An adaptive algorithm</strong> takes into account the elements in a list that are
                            already sorted and
                            doesn‚Äôt attempt to re-order them. </p>

                        <p><strong>The non-adaptive Algorithm</strong> re-orders every single element from scratch and
                            doesn‚Äôt consider

                            Searching Algorithm
                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            Searching algorithms locate specific elements among a collection of data from the data
                            structure. Hundreds of software applications and search engines like Google and Amazon use
                            searching algorithms to find and retrieve a specific item. </p>

                        <p>Let‚Äôs look at the two most popular types of searching algorithms:</p>

                        <h4>Linear Search</h4>
                        <p>In linear search, every item is checked one by one in a sequenced way. If we find the match,
                            that specific item is returned, or else the search continues till the end of the structure.
                            Linear search works best while finding an element in an unsorted data collection.</p>

                        <h4>Binary Search</h4>
                        <p>This algorithm searches for an item by dividing the list in half again and again until we
                            narrow down the possible locations to just one. </p>

                        <p>Remember how we select multiple clothes at first, and then we keep eliminating the less-liked
                            ones until we have the final design remaining? </p>

                        <p>Binary Search works somewhat similar to that. However, it works only when we‚Äôve already
                            sorted the data
                        </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            Linked list, as we have discussed in Data structure, starts with a link element called
                            ‚Äòfirst‚Äô. Each element or node has two fields ‚Äì data field(s) and a link field called next
                            which points to the next element. </p>

                        <h4> Types of Linked List</h4>
                        <p> <strong>Single linked list ‚Äì </strong>Only forward navigation is possible.</p>
                        <p><strong>Doubly linked list ‚Äì</strong> Both forward and backward navigation is possible.</p>
                        <p><strong> Circular linked list ‚Äì</strong> Last element points to the first element as ‚Äònext‚Äô
                            and the first element contains a link to the last element as ‚Äòprevious‚Äô resulting in a
                            circular setup.
